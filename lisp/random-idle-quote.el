;;; Commentary:

;; Add:
;;
;;   (require 'random-idle-quote)
;;   (random-idle-quote)
;;
;; to your ~/.emacs ... when your emacs goes into idle mode, a quote
;; will appear in your echo window. I use it to help me remember new
;; things. The quotes that have come with it are straight from
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/EmacsNiftyTricks
;;
;; But feel free to customize the random-idle-quotes to something more
;; useful to yourself.

;;; Thanks:

;; Many people on irc.freenode.net#emacs
